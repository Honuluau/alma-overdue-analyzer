        <p>I know close to nothing about front-end, it took me weeks to make my own website to manage a 100,000 word journal almost a year ago.</p>
        <p>This is like speaking Chinese and then they tell you to speak Japanese</p>
        <p>I can't even get the icon to work. I'm just gonna make the backend work first THEN do this.</p>
